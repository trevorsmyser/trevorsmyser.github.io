<p>This has been one of my favorite dishes to make lately. So whether it may be for a party, or just an easy meal at home, this Buffalo Chicken Dip is the recipe for a great night.<br> I always make sure to use <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Frank-s-RedHot-Hot-Sauce-Original-23-fl-oz-Hot-Sauces/15556135?athbdg=L1600&adsRedirect=true">Frank's Red Hot</a> rather than any other sauce. To me, it makes this dish taste so much better compared to any other sauce. Another ingredient I always use to make this dish is <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Great-Value-Finely-Shredded-Mild-Cheddar-Cheese-16-oz/22057338?from=/search">Great Value Mild Cheddar Cheese</a>. I have experimented with other choices, and I have honestly not seen much of a difference between them. So, I typically go with this cheese, because it just as good as the others, but it is cheaper.</p>
